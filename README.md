# 📊 Risk Analysis in Banking and Financial Sector  

## 📌 Project Overview  
In the banking and financial sector, **loan approval decisions** involve significant risks. Financial institutions must evaluate applicants carefully, as poor decisions can lead to:  

- **Opportunity Loss** – when a reliable applicant is denied a loan.  
- **Financial Loss** – when a high-risk applicant is approved and defaults.  

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world loan applicant data to identify repayment patterns and highlight risk factors. The ultimate goal is to help financial institutions **distinguish between potential defaulters and trustworthy clients**, thereby minimizing risk and improving profitability.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Loan providers face difficulties due to:  
- Applicants with **insufficient account balance** or weak financial health.  
- Applicants with **no prior credit history**.  

Some borrowers exploit this and default, creating losses.  
👉 The challenge is to **predict potential defaulters in advance and approve loans for low-risk clients only**.

## 🛠️ Approach  
1. Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover repayment patterns.  
2. Identified key demographic, social, and financial attributes influencing default risk.  
3. Segregated applicants into **likely defaulters vs. non-defaulters**.  
4. Generated insights to improve **loan approval policies** and **risk assessment models**.
